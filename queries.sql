#
# Query 1: The SQL query retrieves data from the "Customer" table and performs several calculations. 
# First, it extracts the enrollment year from the "enrollment_date" column for each customer and casts it as an integer.
# Next, it counts the distinct customer IDs to determine the total number of customers for each enrollment year.
# Then, it uses a conditional statement to count the distinct customer IDs for customers who have a "Recency" value greater than 30, 
# indicating churned customers. Finally, it calculates the churn rate by dividing the count of churned customers by the total number 
# of customers and multiplying by 100. The results are grouped by enrollment year and ordered in ascending order.
